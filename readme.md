# Blog Posts

This repo contains my blog post. 
You can see a rendered version of by post on my personal website: https://yhhan.net/blog (currently under maintainance)

I plan to include all my programming notes in this repo, edited and published as blog. 
This approach may differ from the the common practise, which is to organise personal notes in a different place, and select some of the best to edit and publish. 
These troublesome seems, to me, fruitless. The notes of knowledge that is not worthy to be showed public may not be worthy to exist at all, as in several months or years, the author himself would be no different from an ordinary reade to his own work. So here it is. 

OMNES ISTIC PONO.
